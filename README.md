Dynamic File Renamer
====================

A small python script designed to help bulk renaming of files. There are a lot of other ways of doing this, obviously, but this one has some nice options, a clear command-line interface, and is nicely customizable.


### How to use
```
usage: This script is designed to iterate over a given directory and change names of the files to specification
       [-h] [-d FILE_DIR] -p STR_PATTERN -r REPLACE_WITH [-v]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d FILE_DIR, --directory FILE_DIR
  -p STR_PATTERN, --pattern STR_PATTERN
  -r REPLACE_WITH, --replacement REPLACE_WITH
  -v, --verbose
```
